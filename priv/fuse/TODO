mnesia:system_info and mnesia:table_info

monitor pids and clean up state table
monitor ports and clean up state table
  no erlang:monitor for ports, but could create a seperate process 
  that links, traps exits, and then exits, and monitor that

crazy idea: write mode, e.g.,
      echo "128000" > /tmp/sux/processes/\<0.13.0\>/heap_size
